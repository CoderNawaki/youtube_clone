# Caveman Compress

## Purpose

Compress natural language files (AGENTS.md, todos, preferences) into caveman-speak to reduce input tokens. Compressed version overwrites original. Human-readable backup saved as `<filename>.original.md`.

## Compression Rules

### Remove

- Articles: a, an, the
- Filler: just, really, basically, actually, simply, essentially, generally
- Pleasantries: "sure", "certainly", "of course", "happy to", "I'd recommend"
- Hedging: "it might be worth", "you could consider", "it would be good to"
- Redundant phrasing: "in order to" → "to", "make sure to" → "ensure"

### Preserve EXACTLY (never modify)

- Code blocks (fenced ``` and indented)
- Inline code (`backtick content`)
- URLs and links
- File paths
- Commands (`npm install`, `git commit`, `docker build`)
- Technical terms (library names, API names, protocols)
- Proper nouns (project names, people, companies)
- Dates, version numbers, numeric values

### Compress

- Use short synonyms: "big" not "extensive", "fix" not "implement a solution for"
- Fragments OK: "Run tests before commit" not "You should always run tests before committing"
- Drop "you should", "make sure to", "remember to" — just state the action
